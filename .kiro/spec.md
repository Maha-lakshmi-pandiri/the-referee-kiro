## The Referee – Decision Helper

## Problem
Users struggle to choose AWS compute services because each option has trade-offs.
Most tools give a single answer without explaining why.

## Goal
Help users compare AWS compute options using constraints
and clearly explain pros, cons, and trade-offs.

## Constraints Used
- Traffic level
- Latency sensitivity

## Output
The tool recommends an option and explains:
- Why it was chosen
- What trade-offs the user accepts
- When the choice may not be ideal

## Why Kiro
Kiro helps structure decisions logically instead of guessing,
making AI responses transparent and explainable.
